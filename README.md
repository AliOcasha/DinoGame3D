# DinoJump 

Remaking the Google Dinsoaur Game as a Endless 3D Runner.  
Thats my fourth Game overall and my first one with Unity.  

## __How to install?__
In the repo you have the main branch with the files and folders needed for *Unity*. So you can either clone it and start it in Unity to make your changes and build it on your on.  

Or you can jump to the Build branch where I stored the *executable* along with the needed files and folders. This you can just download in a folder or as a zip and simply click the .exe and have fun!
## __How to play?__

By pressing the left and right arrow key or the a/d keys you can move _left and right_ to avoid Obstacles.  
By Pressing w or the up arrow key you can _Jump_, but be careful you cant move mid-air!  

### __*The Goal*__ 
__is to get as far as possible without coliding with the cacti or the Pterosaurus in the air, while the Dinosaur has the Run of his Live.__
